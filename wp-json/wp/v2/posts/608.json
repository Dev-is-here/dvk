For accommodation, of course. Is that the only reason? Also perhaps for a quick friendly get together and a \u2018party\u2019, maybe. This is the hint in one of OYO\u2019s latest bunch of ad films which also doubles up as a music video. The video is part of the brand\u2019s latest campaign which comprises three other ad films as well. Sung by musician Knox Artiste, the anthem-like rhythm probably aims to make the repetitive \u2018Oyo yo yo\u2019 stick to the consumers\u2019 minds. The video also highlights topics like \u2018friends\u2019, \u2018ease\u2019, \u2018pocket-friendliness\u2019 etc. While the video isn\u2019t at all the \u2018travel and living\u2019 type, the three other films (TVCs) from the campaign highlight private space, good accommodation and the ease of accessing the aforementioned services.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/NFxDXWOYFI4\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\"><\/iframe>\n\n\n\n<p>However, OYO as an advertiser hasn\u2019t had too many beeps on our radar over the years and this campaign could very well be the brand\u2019s \u2018Get! Set! Go!\u2019 in terms of its advertising journey. The brand has gone all out with its media plan making TV, radio and digital platforms like TikTok, YouTube and ShareChat a part of it. Aggressive branding of OYO operated hotels doubles up as its outdoor ads.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/ERBijva0fI4\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\"><\/iframe>\n\n\n\n<p>Gaurav Ajmera, COO, OYO Hotels &amp; Homes \u2013 India, tells afaqs! that the music video is in continuation of the TVCs that have millennials, business travellers and families as their target audience. While he disagrees that the the video is supposed to look like a \u2018party venue\u2019 use case, he says that it would depend on how the communication is perceived and later interpreted. He explains that the song helps extend the \u2018Raho mast with OYO\u2019 and the \u2018OYO Yo Yo\u2019 identities from the TV to digital domains. \u201cThe objective was not to drive transactions but to create virality around the brand in a way that it would appeal to the larger chunk of our target segments, the millennials &#8211; aged between 20-34 years.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We asked him if there were plans to propagate the music video on radio since the campaign already had a significant audio aspect to it. \u201cNot currently, because we just had our radio campaign which ran during our winter sale that ended on December 3. We did not want to overdo radio and preferred to keep the campaign more internet based,\u201d Ajmera responds.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text alignwide is-stacked-on-mobile\"><figure class=\"wp-block-media-text__media\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"575\" src=\"http:\/\/www.knoxartiste.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/gaurav-1024x575.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-610\" srcset=\"http:\/\/www.knoxartiste.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/gaurav-1024x575.png 1024w, http:\/\/www.knoxartiste.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/gaurav-300x168.png 300w, http:\/\/www.knoxartiste.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/gaurav-768x431.png 768w, http:\/\/www.knoxartiste.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/gaurav.png 1268w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure><div class=\"wp-block-media-text__content\">\n<p>\u201cOnce we zeroed in on what we wanted, we decided that apart from the catchy tune, the communication should also include OYO\u2019s propositions (like affordability etc.). Our team spent time with the artist and highlighted the promises of the brand. We came down to a list of 10 to 12 things that needed to be mentioned. We decided to go ahead with the OYO Townhouse property as the venue since it is targeted at millennials,\u201d he adds.<\/p>\n<\/div><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>However, despite having a really wide and fast expanding footprint as a brand, OYO hasn\u2019t been a big advertiser so far. This probably is the brand\u2019s first big outing. Why, we ask.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>&#8220;Much of our marketing effort so far has been directed towards branding our OYO properties.&#8221;<\/p><cite>Gaurav Ajmera<\/cite><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThat is where the investment has been. In the first four to five years of OYO\u2019s journey, we have majorly been in the top 100-150 cities. Mediums like YouTube and Facebook, coupled with organic conversations, were driving our KPIs (Key Performance Indicators). Over the last 18 months, we have spread out to about 500 cities &#8211; into the width and depth of the country. While we always knew that the orthodox marketing channels were not enough, we realised that TV was the best medium to reach the wide customer base. This was the key reason behind the brand campaign. We were thinking about doing it for the last few months and decided to do it in December since it was the peak season,\u201d Ajmera says.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once the expansion plans were in place, it was time to to connect to the population in areas around cities that bore the OYO footprint. \u201cOur research revealed that a city like Bhilai gets visitors from Durg, Ranchi and many other nearby smaller towns. Our ability to reach them was limited and our recall value in those markets was very low since we were just getting there,\u201d he reveals.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And guess who stepped into OYO\u2019s scene&#8230;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ajmera opens up about the brand\u2019s media strategy saying, \u201cOver the last several months, we were building our recall via mediums like TikTok which we have been using for the last 10 months now. We wanted to go even deeper in markets where even communicating in English was an issue. That\u2019s when we decided to use ShareChat (social media startup in Indian languages). Once we felt that we had achieved a basic goal, we decided to do a TV ad. The TVCs which are being propagated in six languages and over 33 per cent of the spots are in regional languages like Tamil, Malayalam, Kannada, Telugu, Marathi and Bengali.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The TV ads have been crafted by OYO\u2019s in-house creative team led by Mayur Hola, former NCD of Havas whom OYO roped in earlier this year as the creative head for India and South-East Asia. The influencer-led music video campaign in collaboration with Knox Artiste has been led by OYO&#8217;s in-house influencer marketing team. OYO also has an external agency partner in the form of Animal, a Delhi-based agency. Speaking about the work flow between the in-house team and the external partner, Ajmera says, \u201cWe are a very ROI-focused company. All campaigns start with the message we want to drive and the outcome or the key KPI we want to achieve. And that is done with Mayur (Hola), who is our in-house industry expert and the one who takes the creative call. Mayur and I work very closely almost on a daily basis. Once the campaign aspects are clear, it is taken over by his team who further co-ordinate necessary work with the external agency.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Speaking about the future of OYO\u2019s advertising in India, Ajmera says, \u201cI think we will continue to spend decently on brand campaigns. And for the next year, we will be seen much more regularly because we will be going deeper in the existing 500 cities. There won\u2019t just be spurts of campaigns here and there. Although we do not have a clear plan in place, we will continue to invest in brand campaigns.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Industry Speak:<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text alignwide is-stacked-on-mobile\" style=\"grid-template-columns:20% auto\"><figure class=\"wp-block-media-text__media\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"200\" height=\"200\" src=\"http:\/\/www.knoxartiste.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/shre.jpeg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-611\" srcset=\"http:\/\/www.knoxartiste.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/shre.jpeg 200w, http:\/\/www.knoxartiste.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/shre-150x150.jpeg 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" \/><\/figure><div class=\"wp-block-media-text__content\">\n<p>Shrenik Gandhi, CEO and co-founder, White Rivers Media, says, \u201cThe song is catchy, will resonate with the young audience and will travel across groups too. The song&#8217;s lyrics must be paid special attention to, as it has a lot of short statements generally used by the millennials and Gen Z.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s a fresh approach by the brand to hit out to the \u2018party enthusiastic youth\u2019. These youth are generally tight on budgets and may not be able to afford a luxury\/semi-luxury hotel, yet have aspirations to party\/stay in Instagram worthy places. In that regard, the campaign scores a good set of points. Kudos to the efforts of the brand,\u201d Gandhi adds.<\/p>\n<\/div><\/div>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"\/>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text alignwide has-media-on-the-right is-stacked-on-mobile\" style=\"grid-template-columns:auto 17%\"><figure class=\"wp-block-media-text__media\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"200\" height=\"287\" src=\"http:\/\/www.knoxartiste.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/Prashant-Nair.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-612\"\/><\/figure><div class=\"wp-block-media-text__content\">\n<p>Prashant Nair, associate creative director, FoxyMoron says, \u201cLyrics are good. They capture the feel. This alone can fetch surprisingly good performance for the video. O..Yo&#8230;Yo is very catchy and does stick in the mind.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cHowever, the set-up is decent but lacks \u2018swag\u2019 in terms of visual transitions, lack of \u2018copy text\u2019 overlays (like in between 0:04 seconds and 0:06 seconds) and \u2018pop artsy&#8217; icons, etc. The initial bit is too long. The pace of the visual is slower than the tempo\/energy of the music. Lighting direction used in the video is average and that affects the output. For lack of better words, it looks a bit \u2018dingy\u2019. It looks like there has been no colour correction done on the video. The artist has performed well, but he could have been made to do many things,\u201d he adds.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cBut at the end of the day, every asset can serve some objective.
