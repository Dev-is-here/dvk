<h3>&#8220;We wanted to encourage friends to practice social distancing and celebrate virtually!&#8221;</h3>



<p>Beverage Brand,&nbsp;<a href="https://brandequity.economictimes.indiatimes.com/tag/pepsi">Pepsi</a>&nbsp;pays a tribute to friends across the nation by launching a special piece of content in collaboration with popular singer&nbsp;Knox Artiste.</p>



<p>The song is built on an insight wherein the brand conducted a poll and found that in current times, 87% consumers are missing their friends immensely while at home. The poll results also reflected that 78% people believe that friends contribute to their happiness. Therefore, the foot tapping tribute encourages people to up their Swag level this&nbsp;Friendship Day&nbsp;and mark this occasion by connecting virtually with their loved ones, the company said in a press statement.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>“Through this special content, Pepsi aims at encouraging consumers to celebrate one of the most beautiful emotion of friendship virtually with swag. We are confident that Knox Artiste’s riveting music will have people across the nation want to connect this Friendship Day and set up a virtual party with friends that they’ve missed spending time with for so long.”</p><cite>Tarun  Bhagat &#8211; Director of Marketing, PepsiCo India</cite></blockquote>

<p>In the video, Artiste can be seen grooving to the tunes of the catchy number which says &#8216;<em>aaja jashan manaye mere yaar, poore tashan me ayein mere yaar. Maare gut gut ghoont do chaar, bole toh hai tu bada Swag star.&#8217;</em></p>

<h3>&#8220;Knox Artiste encourages users of social networking platforms to upload video&#8221;</h3>



<p>Want to let the coronavirus pandemic know that you can &#8216;beat it&#8217;? You can now participate in the #RapCorona Challenge and become part of a crowd-sourced music video, thanks to music producer Knox Artiste.</p>



<p>A well-known Dubai-based Indian music producer, rapper, and singer, Knox has taken it upon himself to let the world know humanity will collectively endure the hard times, and come out stronger by kick-starting the #RapCorona Challenge. With a fan following of over 2.4 million subscribers on YouTube, Knox, best known for his hit tracks&nbsp;<em>Flashup, I&#8217;m the One, Botal Khol,</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Paisa</em>, has been singing, rapping, songwriting, producing music and making videos on his YouTube Channel for nine years.</p>



<p><strong>What&#8217;s the RapCorona</strong><br>Challenge all about? The RapCorona Challenge, encourages users of social networking TikTok and Instagram to use the audio provided on Knox&#8217;s official YouTube Channel &#8211; Knox Artiste or use the official RapCorona sound from his official TikTok Page &#8211; @iamknoxartiste and upload a video. &#8220;Use the audio to make the most creative video in the safety of your home. Use the #RapCorona hashtag and tag @iamknoxartiste so we can find your videos. I plan on featuring the most creative videos for the #RapCorona music video. Obviously, I want people to only send videos from the safety of their homes,&#8221; says Knox.</p>



<p>Speaking to&nbsp;<em>City Times</em>, Knox says, &#8220;The #RapCorona Challenge involves my friends, fans and social media influencers across online platforms, who have come together to give a simple message through the hook of the song, which roughly translates to us telling the virus that &#8211; &#8220;We can hit you harder than you&#8217;ve hit us.&#8221; He adds, &#8220;(Also) standing together and spreading awareness to audiences in Dubai and back home that staying home really does work in beating this pandemic.&#8221;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>&#8220;I have two aims with the #RapCorona Challenge. The first one is to keep people entertained &#8211; either by making or watching the videos in their homes while they wait for all this to blow over. Also, it can be very frustrating staying home for such an extended period, we need something different to challenge our minds and creativity.&#8221;</p><cite>Knox Artiste</cite></blockquote>



<p>Knox&#8217;s second aim is to reach out to people and inform them about how essential it is to stay home during this period. &#8220;I have a collective view of over 200 million views on YouTube. With this challenge, I hope more people spread the message that there is nothing more important than staying at home at the moment,&#8221; he says.</p>



<p><strong>How did the #RapCorona Challenge come about?</strong><br>&#8220;The idea came to me when I first heard about Covid-19 in February, but I was considering not going through with it as some may find it insensitive. However, my aim is only to spread some semblance of positivity by telling the universe that we as humans can overcome anything. If my music can help put a smile on someone&#8217;s face, then that&#8217;s enough,&#8221; Knox says. &#8220;I think music always plays a very important role. It&#8217;s a universal language that brings people together. A 3-minute song can have more impact than an hour-long speech,&#8221; he feels.</p>



<p><strong><strong>Why TikTok?</strong><br>The #RapCorona Challenge requires users to submit videos via TikTok and Instagram. When asked if he&#8217;s worried over the backlash from using a controversial Chinese app, Knox says, &#8220;The reason we went with TikTok was to achieve a higher reach to the audiences that are not active on YouTube and Facebook.&#8221; He adds, &#8220;Honestly, I&#8217;m not worried about any backlash as I&#8217;m not the only musician using the app to promote my musical content. I think that TikTok is a very good tool for people to show their creativity in making videos. There have been multiple incidents of &#8216;user data&#8217; being leveraged by social media platforms that have not come from China.&#8221;</strong></p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Artistes like Naezy, Knox Artiste, Prabh Deep and Ritviz are singing with brands. Unlike jingle-like brief ad copies, these associations lead to complete music videos designed to be hummable, shareable and to be a part of playlists.</p>

<div class="wp-block-media-text alignwide is-stacked-on-mobile" style="grid-template-columns:43% auto"><figure class="wp-block-media-text__media"><img loading="lazy" width="699" height="423" src="http://www.knoxartiste.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/news2-1.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-594" srcset="http://www.knoxartiste.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/news2-1.jpg 699w, http://www.knoxartiste.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/news2-1-300x182.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 699px) 100vw, 699px" /></figure><div class="wp-block-media-text__content">
<p>The 2019 production Gully Boy, a feature film about the underground Indian rap scene helped zoom in on the &#8216;others&#8217; in the Indian music scene. This supernova, the shock wave of which rippled through digital mediums, created lots of smaller instant stars. It&#8217;s not that they hadn&#8217;t worked hard for it but suddenly, they achieved a significant amount of the mainstream limelight. And brands like limelight.</p>



<p>Branded music videos used to be the refuge for alcobev brands that are barred from going la-la-la across mediums of mass outreach. Today, brands across segments are taking to such videos for ads. These ads feature smaller non-mainstream stars who have a decent digital presence, which at times might seem bigger than mainstream faces as well. We did witness a spurt in &#8216;rap&#8217; ads right after Gully Boy but that was more about rap.</p>
</div></div>



<p>BookMyShow just launched its brand campaign in the form of a music video featuring Punjabi rapper Prabh Deep (35.6K subscribers on YouTube). Pepsi partnered rapper Knox Artiste for Har Ghoont Mein Swag (2.28M subscribers on YouTube), so did OYO for its O Yo Yo music video. Edutech brand Unacademy partnered rapper Naezy (638K subscribers on YouTube) for its Let&#8217;s Crack It! Anthem. Naezy also crafted the Rukta Nah track in partnership with OnePlus.</p>



<iframe loading="lazy" width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8dTfH1XZwe8" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><em>Artistes like Naezy, Knox Artiste, Prabh Deep and Ritviz are singing with brands. Unlike jingle-like brief ad copies, these associations lead to complete music videos designed to be hummable, shareable and to be a part of playlists.</em></p><cite><a href="https://www.afaqs.com/news/advertising/brands-musicians-and-commercial-messages" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">afaqs.com</a></cite></blockquote>



<p>In a way, all these are efforts that mirror what brands like Bacardi did over years as part of their surrogate advertising. As a strategy, this closely resembles Liggi, a viral music video launched as a part of the Bacardi Sessions series and crafted by Ritviz, a digital first singer, DJ and dance music producer.</p>



<p>It looks like brands are out to make the most of the quick fame as none of these are long term associations or endorsement deals. But how do they get the fit right? It probably has to with the followers and audience base these artistes command &#8211; what the industry calls &#8216;amplification&#8217; of campaigns. After all, we are talking millions of views.</p>



<h2>Expert Speak:</h2>



<div class="wp-block-media-text alignwide is-stacked-on-mobile" style="grid-template-columns:47% auto"><figure class="wp-block-media-text__media"><img loading="lazy" width="639" height="360" src="http://www.knoxartiste.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/ash.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-591" srcset="http://www.knoxartiste.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/ash.jpeg 639w, http://www.knoxartiste.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/ash-300x169.jpeg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 639px) 100vw, 639px" /></figure><div class="wp-block-media-text__content">
<p>Ashutosh Harbola, chief executive officer, Buzzoka, an influencer marketing agency, maintains that there isn&#8217;t a set of qualification metrics for a brand selecting a rising star. He says, &#8220;It is basically about who fits the marketing mix of a certain campaign. There can be hundreds of reasons for the selection, but eventually the first hand appeal to audience is what matters.&#8221;</p>
</div></div>



<p>&#8220;The trend of using upcoming musicians or non-mainstream artistes is either part of moment marketing or capitalising on the audience that the individual appeals to. For example, Let&#8217;s Crack It Anthem by Unacademy is a perfect blend of both Naezy&#8217;s topical fame as well as his struggles as an artist connecting back to the problem that Unacademy solves as a product. On the other side, if you see Ritviz’s Liggi video for Bacardi, it is about tying up with the persona of the artist that created Udd Gaye. With Udd Gaye, Ritviz created his flamboyant image pegged with EDM and hip hop culture that is picking up in India. Bacardi was smart enough to capitalise on this. Both the above examples are basically great pieces of selection by these brands, considering the value proposition they have driven out of them,&#8221; Harbola adds.</p>



<div class="wp-block-media-text alignwide is-stacked-on-mobile" style="grid-template-columns:40% auto"><figure class="wp-block-media-text__media"><img loading="lazy" width="639" height="359" src="http://www.knoxartiste.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/carl.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-592" srcset="http://www.knoxartiste.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/carl.jpg 639w, http://www.knoxartiste.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/carl-300x169.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 639px) 100vw, 639px" /></figure><div class="wp-block-media-text__content">
<p>Carlton D&#8217;Silva, chief executive officer and chief creative officer, Hungama Digital Services, says, &#8220;Some of them are big. The main reason behind bringing such artistes on board is reach and an appeal to the brands core TG. If you see, all the brands here serve an audience that is predominantly millennial and Gen Z. They listen to these artistes and they are mainstream in their eyes. It&#8217;s a great way to garner some pertinent eyeballs and in turn, reach out to their TG more effectively. A good song adds more bang for your buck because now that has more visual as well as audible appeal, enabling you to use that piece of communication on more marketable mediums.&#8221;</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Why does one book a hotel room? For accommodation, of course. Is that the only reason? Also perhaps for a quick friendly get together and a ‘party’, maybe. This is the hint in one of OYO’s latest bunch of ad films which also doubles up as a music video. The video is part of the brand’s latest campaign which comprises three other ad films as well. Sung by musician Knox Artiste, the anthem-like rhythm probably aims to make the repetitive ‘Oyo yo yo’ stick to the consumers’ minds.</p>

<p>Why does one book a hotel room? For accommodation, of course. Is that the only reason? Also perhaps for a quick friendly get together and a ‘party’, maybe. This is the hint in one of OYO’s latest bunch of ad films which also doubles up as a music video. The video is part of the brand’s latest campaign which comprises three other ad films as well. Sung by musician Knox Artiste, the anthem-like rhythm probably aims to make the repetitive ‘Oyo yo yo’ stick to the consumers’ minds. The video also highlights topics like ‘friends’, ‘ease’, ‘pocket-friendliness’ etc. While the video isn’t at all the ‘travel and living’ type, the three other films (TVCs) from the campaign highlight private space, good accommodation and the ease of accessing the aforementioned services.</p>



<iframe loading="lazy" width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NFxDXWOYFI4" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>



<p>However, OYO as an advertiser hasn’t had too many beeps on our radar over the years and this campaign could very well be the brand’s ‘Get! Set! Go!’ in terms of its advertising journey. The brand has gone all out with its media plan making TV, radio and digital platforms like TikTok, YouTube and ShareChat a part of it. Aggressive branding of OYO operated hotels doubles up as its outdoor ads.</p>



<iframe loading="lazy" width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ERBijva0fI4" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>



<p>Gaurav Ajmera, COO, OYO Hotels &amp; Homes – India, tells afaqs! that the music video is in continuation of the TVCs that have millennials, business travellers and families as their target audience. While he disagrees that the the video is supposed to look like a ‘party venue’ use case, he says that it would depend on how the communication is perceived and later interpreted. He explains that the song helps extend the ‘Raho mast with OYO’ and the ‘OYO Yo Yo’ identities from the TV to digital domains. “The objective was not to drive transactions but to create virality around the brand in a way that it would appeal to the larger chunk of our target segments, the millennials &#8211; aged between 20-34 years.”</p>



<p>We asked him if there were plans to propagate the music video on radio since the campaign already had a significant audio aspect to it. “Not currently, because we just had our radio campaign which ran during our winter sale that ended on December 3. We did not want to overdo radio and preferred to keep the campaign more internet based,” Ajmera responds.</p>

<p>“Once we zeroed in on what we wanted, we decided that apart from the catchy tune, the communication should also include OYO’s propositions (like affordability etc.). Our team spent time with the artist and highlighted the promises of the brand. We came down to a list of 10 to 12 things that needed to be mentioned. We decided to go ahead with the OYO Townhouse property as the venue since it is targeted at millennials,” he adds.</p>
</div></div>



<p>However, despite having a really wide and fast expanding footprint as a brand, OYO hasn’t been a big advertiser so far. This probably is the brand’s first big outing. Why, we ask.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>&#8220;Much of our marketing effort so far has been directed towards branding our OYO properties.&#8221;</p><cite>Gaurav Ajmera</cite></blockquote>



<p>“That is where the investment has been. In the first four to five years of OYO’s journey, we have majorly been in the top 100-150 cities. Mediums like YouTube and Facebook, coupled with organic conversations, were driving our KPIs (Key Performance Indicators). Over the last 18 months, we have spread out to about 500 cities &#8211; into the width and depth of the country. While we always knew that the orthodox marketing channels were not enough, we realised that TV was the best medium to reach the wide customer base. This was the key reason behind the brand campaign. We were thinking about doing it for the last few months and decided to do it in December since it was the peak season,” Ajmera says.</p>



<p>Once the expansion plans were in place, it was time to to connect to the population in areas around cities that bore the OYO footprint. “Our research revealed that a city like Bhilai gets visitors from Durg, Ranchi and many other nearby smaller towns. Our ability to reach them was limited and our recall value in those markets was very low since we were just getting there,” he reveals.</p>



<p>And guess who stepped into OYO’s scene&#8230;</p>



<p>Ajmera opens up about the brand’s media strategy saying, “Over the last several months, we were building our recall via mediums like TikTok which we have been using for the last 10 months now. We wanted to go even deeper in markets where even communicating in English was an issue. That’s when we decided to use ShareChat (social media startup in Indian languages). Once we felt that we had achieved a basic goal, we decided to do a TV ad. The TVCs which are being propagated in six languages and over 33 per cent of the spots are in regional languages like Tamil, Malayalam, Kannada, Telugu, Marathi and Bengali.”</p>



<p>The TV ads have been crafted by OYO’s in-house creative team led by Mayur Hola, former NCD of Havas whom OYO roped in earlier this year as the creative head for India and South-East Asia. The influencer-led music video campaign in collaboration with Knox Artiste has been led by OYO&#8217;s in-house influencer marketing team. OYO also has an external agency partner in the form of Animal, a Delhi-based agency. Speaking about the work flow between the in-house team and the external partner, Ajmera says, “We are a very ROI-focused company. All campaigns start with the message we want to drive and the outcome or the key KPI we want to achieve. And that is done with Mayur (Hola), who is our in-house industry expert and the one who takes the creative call. Mayur and I work very closely almost on a daily basis. Once the campaign aspects are clear, it is taken over by his team who further co-ordinate necessary work with the external agency.”</p>



<p>Speaking about the future of OYO’s advertising in India, Ajmera says, “I think we will continue to spend decently on brand campaigns. And for the next year, we will be seen much more regularly because we will be going deeper in the existing 500 cities. There won’t just be spurts of campaigns here and there. Although we do not have a clear plan in place, we will continue to invest in brand campaigns.”</p>



<h2>Industry Speak:</h2>

<p>Shrenik Gandhi, CEO and co-founder, White Rivers Media, says, “The song is catchy, will resonate with the young audience and will travel across groups too. The song&#8217;s lyrics must be paid special attention to, as it has a lot of short statements generally used by the millennials and Gen Z.”</p>



<p>“It’s a fresh approach by the brand to hit out to the ‘party enthusiastic youth’. These youth are generally tight on budgets and may not be able to afford a luxury/semi-luxury hotel, yet have aspirations to party/stay in Instagram worthy places. In that regard, the campaign scores a good set of points. Kudos to the efforts of the brand,” Gandhi adds.</p>

<p>Prashant Nair, associate creative director, FoxyMoron says, “Lyrics are good. They capture the feel. This alone can fetch surprisingly good performance for the video. O..Yo&#8230;Yo is very catchy and does stick in the mind.”</p>



<p>“However, the set-up is decent but lacks ‘swag’ in terms of visual transitions, lack of ‘copy text’ overlays (like in between 0:04 seconds and 0:06 seconds) and ‘pop artsy&#8217; icons, etc. The initial bit is too long. The pace of the visual is slower than the tempo/energy of the music. Lighting direction used in the video is average and that affects the output. For lack of better words, it looks a bit ‘dingy’. It looks like there has been no colour correction done on the video. The artist has performed well, but he could have been made to do many things,” he adds.</p>



<p>“But at the end of the day, every asset can serve some objective. And if this was targeted only towards the Tier 2 segment, it would work wonderfully well,” Nair signs off.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>Knox Artiste</strong>&nbsp;is a young musician brought up in Dubai and hails from the city of&nbsp;<strong>New Delhi</strong>. Backed with more than 14 years of experience in the field of music &amp; entertainment, this all-in-one performer manipulates his technical skills as an audio engineer, his vast knowledge of trending genres and his versatile vocal abilities to create something completely fresh and original for his listeners. He has evolved from a DJ at the age of 14 into one of the most sought after and diverse musicians on YouTube today. Currently, he is working with one of the biggest and popular names in the industry and has had an inspiring journey so far.&nbsp;Let&#8217;s know more about him in the interview below.</p>



<p><strong>In a conversation with Knox Artiste</strong></p>



<p><strong>1) When did you discover a singer in you?</strong></p>



<p>​I discovered the singer within myself while I was a DJ and producer back in 2006, I always used to end up being dependent on other vocalists for my tracks, that&#8217;s when I started practicing and training my voice. I learnt how to sing by watching Youtube videos and watching other musicians sing.</p>



<p><strong>2) Knox what is music to you?</strong></p>



<p>​Music to me has been my whole identity. People keep asking me what my real name is and I keep telling them that Knox is my name, it&#8217;s not just a brand that has been created, it&#8217;s a parallel life that I have been living since the last 15 years now. When the real me feels down, Knox is who brings me back up.</p>



<p><strong>3) What struggles did you face in the journey so far?</strong></p>



<p>Well, the music profession is a tough game. Especially now that that the internet has made it so easy for anyone to upload their content. It&#8217;s very hard to make yourself known to the right audience. Also, you need to be very patient in this industry.</p>

<p><strong>4) Knox how do you handle mistakes during a performance?</strong></p>



<p>Usually you get used to handling certain situations after a couple of shows and the fix usually comes out naturally after a certain point.</p>



<p><strong>5) Some of the things you cannot live without?</strong></p>



<p>My phone because it keeps me connected with my fans and friends while I&#8217;m traveling and my MacBook because it helps me to work on new Music constantly.</p>



<p><strong>6) Share your live sessions experience at 106.2 BIG FM Dubai?</strong></p>



<p>It was actually a really fun experience. I still remember we kept messing in the studios throughout that session.</p>



<p><strong>7) Knox from where did you got the idea of doing 14 songs on a single beat? And how did you managed to do that?</strong></p>



<p>The idea was actually proposed as a challenge by 106.2 Big FM Dubai and I was pretty excited when the concept was shared with me. The concept was new for me but with help personages like Preeti and Arpit I transformed the concept into reality!</p>

<p><strong>8) Would you like to tell us something about your upcoming projects</strong>?</p>



<p>Yes. I&#8217;m currently working on a new original song as a follow up to my previous original release &#8216;Botal Khol&#8217; which was released on T-Series Music with Jasmine Sandlas. We&#8217;re actually thinking of doing another session with 106.2 Big FM Dubai very soon on a new beat. Also, I have some covers planned to come out on my YouTube channel before the end of the year. So the fans can expect some new music very soon.</p>
