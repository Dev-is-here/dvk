<h3>&#8220;Knox Artiste encourages users of social networking platforms to upload video&#8221;</h3>



<p>Want to let the coronavirus pandemic know that you can &#8216;beat it&#8217;? You can now participate in the #RapCorona Challenge and become part of a crowd-sourced music video, thanks to music producer Knox Artiste.</p>



<p>A well-known Dubai-based Indian music producer, rapper, and singer, Knox has taken it upon himself to let the world know humanity will collectively endure the hard times, and come out stronger by kick-starting the #RapCorona Challenge. With a fan following of over 2.4 million subscribers on YouTube, Knox, best known for his hit tracks&nbsp;<em>Flashup, I&#8217;m the One, Botal Khol,</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Paisa</em>, has been singing, rapping, songwriting, producing music and making videos on his YouTube Channel for nine years.</p>



<p><strong>What&#8217;s the RapCorona</strong><br>Challenge all about? The RapCorona Challenge, encourages users of social networking TikTok and Instagram to use the audio provided on Knox&#8217;s official YouTube Channel &#8211; Knox Artiste or use the official RapCorona sound from his official TikTok Page &#8211; @iamknoxartiste and upload a video. &#8220;Use the audio to make the most creative video in the safety of your home. Use the #RapCorona hashtag and tag @iamknoxartiste so we can find your videos. I plan on featuring the most creative videos for the #RapCorona music video. Obviously, I want people to only send videos from the safety of their homes,&#8221; says Knox.</p>



<p>Speaking to&nbsp;<em>City Times</em>, Knox says, &#8220;The #RapCorona Challenge involves my friends, fans and social media influencers across online platforms, who have come together to give a simple message through the hook of the song, which roughly translates to us telling the virus that &#8211; &#8220;We can hit you harder than you&#8217;ve hit us.&#8221; He adds, &#8220;(Also) standing together and spreading awareness to audiences in Dubai and back home that staying home really does work in beating this pandemic.&#8221;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>&#8220;I have two aims with the #RapCorona Challenge. The first one is to keep people entertained &#8211; either by making or watching the videos in their homes while they wait for all this to blow over. Also, it can be very frustrating staying home for such an extended period, we need something different to challenge our minds and creativity.&#8221;</p><cite>Knox Artiste</cite></blockquote>



<p>Knox&#8217;s second aim is to reach out to people and inform them about how essential it is to stay home during this period. &#8220;I have a collective view of over 200 million views on YouTube. With this challenge, I hope more people spread the message that there is nothing more important than staying at home at the moment,&#8221; he says.</p>



<p><strong>How did the #RapCorona Challenge come about?</strong><br>&#8220;The idea came to me when I first heard about Covid-19 in February, but I was considering not going through with it as some may find it insensitive. However, my aim is only to spread some semblance of positivity by telling the universe that we as humans can overcome anything. If my music can help put a smile on someone&#8217;s face, then that&#8217;s enough,&#8221; Knox says. &#8220;I think music always plays a very important role. It&#8217;s a universal language that brings people together. A 3-minute song can have more impact than an hour-long speech,&#8221; he feels.</p>



<p><strong><strong>Why TikTok?</strong><br>The #RapCorona Challenge requires users to submit videos via TikTok and Instagram. When asked if he&#8217;s worried over the backlash from using a controversial Chinese app, Knox says, &#8220;The reason we went with TikTok was to achieve a higher reach to the audiences that are not active on YouTube and Facebook.&#8221; He adds, &#8220;Honestly, I&#8217;m not worried about any backlash as I&#8217;m not the only musician using the app to promote my musical content. I think that TikTok is a very good tool for people to show their creativity in making videos. There have been multiple incidents of &#8216;user data&#8217; being leveraged by social media platforms that have not come from China.&#8221;</strong></p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Artistes like Naezy, Knox Artiste, Prabh Deep and Ritviz are singing with brands. Unlike jingle-like brief ad copies, these associations lead to complete music videos designed to be hummable, shareable and to be a part of playlists.</p>

<div class="wp-block-media-text alignwide is-stacked-on-mobile" style="grid-template-columns:43% auto"><figure class="wp-block-media-text__media"><img loading="lazy" width="699" height="423" src="http://www.knoxartiste.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/news2-1.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-594" srcset="http://www.knoxartiste.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/news2-1.jpg 699w, http://www.knoxartiste.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/news2-1-300x182.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 699px) 100vw, 699px" /></figure><div class="wp-block-media-text__content">
<p>The 2019 production Gully Boy, a feature film about the underground Indian rap scene helped zoom in on the &#8216;others&#8217; in the Indian music scene. This supernova, the shock wave of which rippled through digital mediums, created lots of smaller instant stars. It&#8217;s not that they hadn&#8217;t worked hard for it but suddenly, they achieved a significant amount of the mainstream limelight. And brands like limelight.</p>



<p>Branded music videos used to be the refuge for alcobev brands that are barred from going la-la-la across mediums of mass outreach. Today, brands across segments are taking to such videos for ads. These ads feature smaller non-mainstream stars who have a decent digital presence, which at times might seem bigger than mainstream faces as well. We did witness a spurt in &#8216;rap&#8217; ads right after Gully Boy but that was more about rap.</p>
</div></div>



<p>BookMyShow just launched its brand campaign in the form of a music video featuring Punjabi rapper Prabh Deep (35.6K subscribers on YouTube). Pepsi partnered rapper Knox Artiste for Har Ghoont Mein Swag (2.28M subscribers on YouTube), so did OYO for its O Yo Yo music video. Edutech brand Unacademy partnered rapper Naezy (638K subscribers on YouTube) for its Let&#8217;s Crack It! Anthem. Naezy also crafted the Rukta Nah track in partnership with OnePlus.</p>



<iframe loading="lazy" width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8dTfH1XZwe8" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><em>Artistes like Naezy, Knox Artiste, Prabh Deep and Ritviz are singing with brands. Unlike jingle-like brief ad copies, these associations lead to complete music videos designed to be hummable, shareable and to be a part of playlists.</em></p><cite><a href="https://www.afaqs.com/news/advertising/brands-musicians-and-commercial-messages" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">afaqs.com</a></cite></blockquote>



<p>In a way, all these are efforts that mirror what brands like Bacardi did over years as part of their surrogate advertising. As a strategy, this closely resembles Liggi, a viral music video launched as a part of the Bacardi Sessions series and crafted by Ritviz, a digital first singer, DJ and dance music producer.</p>



<p>It looks like brands are out to make the most of the quick fame as none of these are long term associations or endorsement deals. But how do they get the fit right? It probably has to with the followers and audience base these artistes command &#8211; what the industry calls &#8216;amplification&#8217; of campaigns. After all, we are talking millions of views.</p>



<h2>Expert Speak:</h2>



<div class="wp-block-media-text alignwide is-stacked-on-mobile" style="grid-template-columns:47% auto"><figure class="wp-block-media-text__media"><img loading="lazy" width="639" height="360" src="http://www.knoxartiste.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/ash.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-591" srcset="http://www.knoxartiste.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/ash.jpeg 639w, http://www.knoxartiste.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/ash-300x169.jpeg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 639px) 100vw, 639px" /></figure><div class="wp-block-media-text__content">
<p>Ashutosh Harbola, chief executive officer, Buzzoka, an influencer marketing agency, maintains that there isn&#8217;t a set of qualification metrics for a brand selecting a rising star. He says, &#8220;It is basically about who fits the marketing mix of a certain campaign. There can be hundreds of reasons for the selection, but eventually the first hand appeal to audience is what matters.&#8221;</p>
</div></div>



<p>&#8220;The trend of using upcoming musicians or non-mainstream artistes is either part of moment marketing or capitalising on the audience that the individual appeals to. For example, Let&#8217;s Crack It Anthem by Unacademy is a perfect blend of both Naezy&#8217;s topical fame as well as his struggles as an artist connecting back to the problem that Unacademy solves as a product. On the other side, if you see Ritviz’s Liggi video for Bacardi, it is about tying up with the persona of the artist that created Udd Gaye. With Udd Gaye, Ritviz created his flamboyant image pegged with EDM and hip hop culture that is picking up in India. Bacardi was smart enough to capitalise on this. Both the above examples are basically great pieces of selection by these brands, considering the value proposition they have driven out of them,&#8221; Harbola adds.</p>



<div class="wp-block-media-text alignwide is-stacked-on-mobile" style="grid-template-columns:40% auto"><figure class="wp-block-media-text__media"><img loading="lazy" width="639" height="359" src="http://www.knoxartiste.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/carl.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-592" srcset="http://www.knoxartiste.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/carl.jpg 639w, http://www.knoxartiste.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/carl-300x169.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 639px) 100vw, 639px" /></figure><div class="wp-block-media-text__content">
<p>Carlton D&#8217;Silva, chief executive officer and chief creative officer, Hungama Digital Services, says, &#8220;Some of them are big. The main reason behind bringing such artistes on board is reach and an appeal to the brands core TG. If you see, all the brands here serve an audience that is predominantly millennial and Gen Z. They listen to these artistes and they are mainstream in their eyes. It&#8217;s a great way to garner some pertinent eyeballs and in turn, reach out to their TG more effectively. A good song adds more bang for your buck because now that has more visual as well as audible appeal, enabling you to use that piece of communication on more marketable mediums.&#8221;</p>
